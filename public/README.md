Modular Backbone JS with Twitter Bootstrap 
==========================================

This is a simple example of using Backbone JS with Require JS for modules and Twitter's bootstrap library for style. This example is heavily based on
the [modular-backbone-updated sample](https://github.com/thomasdavis/backbonetutorials/tree/gh-pages/examples/modular-backbone-updated) by 
[thomasdavis](https://github.com/thomasdavis/).
